#### Notes on HTML and PHP
Please make note of naming conventions (for classes and names) used for consistency. This can be changed, though checks must be made to ensure that changes don't break the applications core functionality.
Divs, classes, ids and other such elements can/should be added in order to help with the styling of the application.
The HTML and PHP should be indented and follow conventions.
